### Project description
We will write code to find the area of a circle, given the radius, but without using a predefined value for pi. The aim is to practise the steps of the Software Development Lifecycle, making use of good practices while using version control collaboratively. We will also practise test-driven development.

### Theoretical solution
We will create a square with sides of length 2r. The square and circle are centred at the origin. We use a Monte Carlo method to randomly sample points within this square. The points inside the circle are counted to obtain an estimate of what percentage of the square is covered by the circle. This percentage is multiplied by the square are to obtain an approximated area of the circle. This approximate area is compared to the actual area to obtain a percentage error. These steps are repeated until the error is less than 0.01.
